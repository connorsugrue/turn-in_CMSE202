You will build two classes for mice, which inhabit the world, and one class for a (predator) hawk. The mice have different fur color, which allows them to blend in better (or worse) with their environment. This model is (loosely) based on an actual case of natural selection involving the [Peppered Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution).\n",
